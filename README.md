# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that informs the user of the current day and displays entries based on a 9-5 work schedule. 

The user can enter free text into any of the hour rows and then save the information into local storage using the save button. 

This was made using jQuery and the Day.js library as part of the UW coding bootcamp. The final project should appear similar to the example image from the course:

Our final edits appear similar to the image below.
